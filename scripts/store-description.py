#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
# Generates docs/store-description.md from README.md.
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/store-description.py            # write the file
#   python scripts/store-description.py --check    # fail if the file is out of date
#
# Why this exists: the Modrinth and Hangar project pages live only on those sites. Nothing
# in the release pipeline writes the Modrinth body - mc-publish uploads versions and a
# per-version changelog and has no description input - so a hand-pasted copy of the
# README has no diff, no history and no review, and goes stale the first time a feature
# or config key changes. SpiralGenesis's Modrinth body did exactly that, and was rejected
# on 2026-09-05 over a markdown rule nobody could review, because the text existed in
# exactly one place.
#
# So the body is derived from the README instead, committed, and checked in CI. The README
# stays the single source of truth; this script removes the parts of it that only make
# sense on github.com and enforces the rule that got that submission rejected. One output
# serves both stores.
#
# What it does NOT do: upload anything. Publishing the result is a manual paste into the
# Modrinth description editor and the Hangar resource page. On Modrinth, an edit alone
# does not re-enter the moderation queue, so a rejected project also needs "Resubmit for
# review". See RELEASE_PROCESS.md.
